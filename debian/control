Description: random useful tools that do not yet have a permanent home
 Bikeshed is a collection of random but useful tools and utilities that
 either don't quite fit anywhere else, or have not yet been accepted
 by a more appropriate project.
 .
 Think of this package as an "orphanage", where tools live until they
 are adopted by loving, accepting parents.
